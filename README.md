Falls occurs with high frequency in the older adults, children, and athletes It is a significant 
concern, particularly for the elderly and those with certain medical conditions, as they can lead 
to serious injuries or even death. It accounts for one of the most common and serious issues 
contributing to a disability, especially among elderly individuals. Among older adults, 
associated medical comorbidities correlate to an increased propensity to fall, and in turn, 
increased susceptibility to injury. 

The primary objective of ‘Fall detection using deep learning’ project is to develop an intelligent 
fall detection system using deep learning. The system will utilize the VGG16 model for feature 
extraction and classification, ensuring high accuracy in detecting falls from images or videos.

The expected outcome of this project is a robust and reliable model for fall detection system 
with high accuracy and minimal false alarms. By utilizing VGG16 and transfer learning, the 
model will be able to distinguish falls from normal activities effectively.
